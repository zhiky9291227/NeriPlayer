## About

NeriPlayer is a native Android audio player built with **Jetpack Compose + Media3**.
It does not build a public cloud service. Instead, it integrates online content
from **NetEase Cloud Music**, **Bilibili**, and **YouTube Music** when the user
has the corresponding third-party platform account capability. It also provides
local playback, downloads, caching, playlist management, and several sync/backup
options.

Current positioning:

- **Account as capability**: third-party platform authorization enables search,
  playback, playlists, and favorites access.
- **Local-first**: playback cache, downloads, playlists, history, settings, and
  auth data are stored locally on the device by default.
- **Optional sync**: playlists, favorites, recent plays, track playback stats,
  playlist open counts, and local-playlist playback stats can
  be synced to your own GitHub repository (repositories created in-app default
  to private) or a WebDAV remote file.
- **Privacy and account safety first**: sync is intentionally decentralized.
  Data is written to GitHub/WebDAV storage that you control, not to a centralized
  service operated by the project maintainer. The app is technically capable of
  sending playback history back to third-party music platforms, but centralized
  music clients often have risk-control and behavior-sampling systems. Uploading
  local playback history directly may be interpreted as abnormal login or playback
  behavior and could put an account at risk. To protect account safety,
  NeriPlayer does not upload local playback history or playback stats back to
  those platforms.
- **Single Activity + Compose**: `MainActivity` is the only external entry point.
  The UI is organized by Compose `NavHost`, a dynamic bottom bar, Mini Player,
  and the Now Playing overlay.
- **Startup and recovery flow**: the normal startup path is
  `Loading -> Disclaimer -> Onboarding -> Main`. If the previous launch ended in
  a crash or system ANR, the app enters `Safe Mode` first.
- **Test guardrails**: download storage, sync merging, YouTube playback compatibility,
  Listen Together, lyrics, playback policies, config backup, and safe mode all
  have focused unit or device tests.

---

## Why it stands out

- **Local-first, with real offline behavior**:
  `NetworkStatusMonitor` follows Android's default direct network transport,
  while `offlineCachedImageRequest` disables remote image requests in offline
  mode and falls back to local caches. Home, Explore, Now Playing, Lyrics,
  playlists, and downloads all receive `offlineMode`, so local files,
  downloaded audio, playback cache, cached covers, and local playlists remain
  usable without a network.
- **Multi-source playback is not just a list of entry points**:
  `PlayerManager` owns playback resolution, queues, and failure recovery. When a
  NetEase track is unavailable, has no playable result, or only returns a preview,
  the player first tries a lower quality, then
  `PlayerManagerNeteaseAutoSourceSwitch` scores Bilibili candidates by title,
  artist, and duration. Playback errors can also refresh the current URL before
  falling back to skip/stop behavior.
- **YouTube playback compatibility has layered fallbacks**:
  valid signed-in identity cookies are preserved and rotated when needed, while
  anonymous visitor sessions keep separate bootstrap and PoToken state. Verified
  signature/n, `player.js`, and challenge results are cached and reused; stale
  player code or a platform-rejected playback candidate falls through to EJS/HLS
  instead of retrying the same unusable candidate.
- **High-performance GLSL/AGSL fluid background**:
  the Now Playing dynamic background is rendered frame-by-frame by
  `BgEffectPainter`, `RuntimeShader`, and
  `assets/shaders/hyper_background_effect.glsl`.
  The shader combines cover-derived colors, animated color blobs, and lightweight
  grain while reacting to `uMusicLevel / uBeat`; it is not just a Gaussian-blurred
  cover. The RuntimeShader/audio-reactive path requires Android 13+. Cover blur
  requires Android 12+, while advanced blur requires Android 13+; older versions
  automatically use a compatible fallback without those effects.
- **Apple Music-style lyrics, backed by the playback pipeline**:
  `SyncedLyricsView` and `AdvancedLyricsView` support line-, word-, and
  character-timed LRC (including trailing timestamps and square-bracket word
  timestamps), plus YRC/TTML highlighting, translated lyrics, phonetic display,
  lyric offset, click-to-seek,
  long-press sharing, depth blur, edge fade, and a full-screen Lyrics page.
  `LyricShareSheet` can select lyric lines, copy text, share the song, or render
  a 1080px lyric card. The Now Playing cover lyric view and bottom Dock can be
  disabled independently; narrow or heavily scaled portrait layouts switch to a
  compact control arrangement with stable touch slots. Long-press selection can
  select a range from the first line to the target line. Lyrics-page Japanese
  lines that contain kana get extra translation spacing so dense glyphs and
  translations do not crowd each other. Floating lyrics, status-bar lyrics,
  SuperLyric, Lyricon, Bluetooth lyrics, and lyric editing reuse the same
  playback data path.
- **Complete local music management**:
  `LocalAudioImportManager` supports external share/open imports, authorized
  folder scanning, device media-library scanning, common audio formats, nearby
  `lrc/txt` lyrics, and `cover/folder/front` cover files. Large scans can show
  a quick preview first, then hydrate richer title/artist/album/cover metadata
  in the background. `LocalPlaylistRepository` manages system local playlists,
  user playlists, favorites, sorting, de-duplication, backup, and sync triggers.
- **Library browsing now has real categories**:
  `Library` is no longer just a playlist list. Local content can switch between
  playlists and artists, while `LocalArtistSummary` groups songs by display
  artist, splits common collaboration artist text, and keeps stable identity
  and cover selection. NetEase songs can open an artist page with songs, albums,
  and follow state.
- **Large screens and daily controls are getting real polish**:
  tablet/landscape Now Playing, Lyrics, Settings, and artist pages use steadier
  width constraints and bottom control layouts. The `Mini Player` supports
  horizontal swipe for previous/next without expanding the full player. Home
  widgets add a 4x2 playback card and a 2x2 mini player. Card backgrounds and
  the primary play button derive their colors from the current artwork. The
  4x2 card shows the song, artwork, progress, four playback controls, and a
  floating-lyrics entry; the 2x2 layout makes artwork the main visual while
  keeping the three core playback controls. Launcher shortcuts can continue
  playback, open Explore, open Library, or shuffle My Favorite Music.
  Main bottom tabs use interruptible directional page transitions that retain both
  outgoing and incoming scenes, avoiding glass, scroll-state, and page-state
  discontinuities during rapid switching. Long-pressing the Now Playing artwork
  opens an immersive preview with pinch-to-zoom, panning, and a download action.
- **Sound controls are tied to the active audio session**:
  `PlaybackEffectsController` applies speed, pitch, Android `Equalizer`, and
  `LoudnessEnhancer` to the current Media3 audio session. Presets, manual bands,
  loudness gain, per-track real-time normalization, fade/crossfade, pause on
  Bluetooth disconnect, channel balance, 32-bit high-resolution system output,
  USB exclusive playback, and audio-focus behavior are all available. Native USB
  exclusive playback currently targets **UAC1.0** and compatible
  **UAC2.0 Type I PCM** audio devices, so system sounds and other apps cannot
  share the USB transport on that path. Device selection, sample-rate/bit-depth/
  buffer policies, 32-bit PCM, software PCM-float conversion, background-playback
  guidance, UAC2 clock-topology and explicit-feedback endpoint resolution,
  startup watchdogs, foreground/background health audits, dynamic transfer
  scaling, and automatic stall recovery are now part of the path. After a long
  scheduling gap, the runtime reacquires the feedback clock instead of continuing
  with a stale rate estimate. Foreground/background recovery chooses wake behavior
  from the network or local source, and bit-perfect volume keeps software gain at
  0 dB so the DAC controls the level. Settings report battery-optimization or
  background-permission limits. While service playback is retained, a background
  audio anchor selects silence or a zero-mean carrier for the actual output route;
  MediaSession provides remote volume routing and the carrier is not user content.
- **Downloads have moved from "can save" to "can recover"**:
  downloads do not use the system `DownloadManager`. They use the shared
  `OkHttpClient`, configurable concurrency, staging files, and sidecar metadata.
  Direct HTTP transfers, platform-specific range transfers, and HLS each have a resume strategy.
  Network-policy pauses can continue later, startup recovery restores unfinished
  queues, and already-finalized local hits are settled directly. Manual
  cancellation cleans up partial artifacts.
- **Storage usage is visible and cleanup has boundaries**:
  `StorageUsageAnalyzer` groups audio cache, image cache, download staging,
  share staging, platform playlist cache, downloaded content, logs, crash
  reports, and core app data. Cache cleanup targets regenerable cache data and
  does not treat user-saved downloads as disposable cache.
- **Self-owned sync plus playback stats**:
  NeriPlayer does not provide a public cloud library or developer-hosted user
  data service. GitHub/WebDAV sync stores playlists, favorites, recent plays,
  and playback stats in the user's own remote. `PlaybackStatsRepository` records
  play count, total listen time, first/last played time, and daily buckets by
  stable track identity, then participates in sync merging. Remote sync snapshots
  tolerate legacy or malformed missing-field payloads, filter records without
  resolvable track identity, and keep songs with missing `addedAt` behind dated
  songs in current display-order playlists. Playback and traffic statistics use
  debounced batch writes, flush at important lifecycle points, and keep a bounded
  number of daily buckets.
- **Traffic controls are built into the product, not bolted on later**:
  `TrafficStatsRepository` tracks playback/download bytes, Wi-Fi/mobile/roaming
  distribution, and cache-hit bytes. Download flows can also warn before high-risk
  mobile or roaming transfers.
- **Highly personalized, beyond theme colors**:
  `AutoSettingsSchema` covers dynamic colors, seed colors, palette style,
  auto/light/dark mode, UI scaling, custom backgrounds, lyric font size,
  lyric blur, two-level advanced blur, Coherent Feedback, the fluid Now Playing background,
  Home card toggles, default start
  destination, haptic feedback, and custom song title/artist/cover metadata.
  OnePlus devices with high-density displays (`densityDpi >= 500`) automatically apply
  an additional `0.95x` UI correction; normal-density devices skip it, while the
  user's manual scale remains an additional multiplier.
  Enhanced Advanced Blur and Coherent Feedback are off by default. With Coherent
  Feedback off, playlist and related detail pages use a drawer-style transition.
  Enhanced Advanced Blur is available only on Android 13+ while its parent blur
  setting is enabled. It adds shared live-glass material to
  screen-level top tabs, the bottom tab bar, and structural settings cards without
  changing foreground content, layout, or touch targets. Its blur radius is adjustable
  from `12-64 dp`.
  Blur quality is configured separately as Ultra Low, Low, Default, or High. Ultra Low
  and Low retain Default's blur coverage while using region-local rendering, dynamic
  downsampling, and RenderNode hardware caching to reduce render work. A detected
  Dimensity SoC defaults to Ultra Low until a preference is saved; local caches are
  rebuilt after background/foreground transitions and quality changes to avoid an
  invalid backdrop after resuming. High requires Enhanced Advanced Blur.
- **ANR, crash logs, and safe mode form a diagnostics loop**:
  `AnrWatchdog` reads Android `ApplicationExitInfo.REASON_ANR` and stores the
  system ANR trace. `ExceptionHandler` and `NativeCrashHandler` record JVM and
  native crashes. If the previous startup failed, `SafeModeManager` can skip full
  app initialization and open safe mode for preview, copy, or export.
- **Listen Together syncs the room, not just a progress bar**:
  the Android client and Cloudflare Worker maintain rooms, roles, queues,
  playback state, repeat/shuffle modes, controller-offline recovery, member
  control requests, optional session playback-candidate sharing, version-gated updates, and
  custom server URLs. Repeat/shuffle changes use `PLAYBACK_MODE` /
  `REQUEST_PLAYBACK_MODE`, while member controls and asynchronous playback-candidate
  results validate the target stable track key so they cannot affect a track
  that has already changed. The client also estimates server clock offset, corrects
  position drift by threshold, and reloads the authoritative playback candidate after an
  asynchronous shared candidate result arrives so pending local startup cannot override
  the room's pause/play command.
  Invites must carry the room secret needed for a first join, while member secrets
  are kept out of public room state. Local tracks cannot create or replace a room
  track. When session candidate sharing is enabled, Durable Objects temporarily
  cache the controller's current playback candidates so listeners can retrieve them
  without waiting for another controller response. A current track keeps at most
  three validated candidates; listeners always resolve with their own quality policy first,
  try those local candidates first, and keep the session-only candidates as isolated startup
  fallbacks, so they never enter song or offline caches. Valid playback-mode queue snapshots
  reuse the requester's real shuffle or restored order without reloading the current track.
  Mode commits re-anchor projected position with the previous repeat semantics. When enabled,
  member joins and explicit departures publish an authoritative room pause; reconnecting with
  the same member credential does not trigger that pause, and both roles keep their WebSocket
  connection alive. A transport-only disconnect remains reconnectable. Durable Objects persist
  room state while WebSocket keeps active
  members in sync.

## Getting Started

### a. Download a Release build (recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cwuom/NeriPlayer/releases).
2. Which APK should you choose?
   - Most phones should use `arm64-v8a`.
   - Older 32-bit devices should use `armeabi-v7a`.
   - `x86` / `x86_64` are mainly for emulators, Intel devices, or Chromebooks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Release channel is not a strict stable channel. Builds are usually pushed
> manually after a batch of features is completed and may still contain issues.

### b. Download a CI build

1. Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cwuom/NeriPlayer/actions), download
   the Artifacts from the latest successful build, and extract them.
2. Or visit [NeriPlayer CI Builds](https://t.me/neriplayer_ci).

> The master CI artifact is `arm64-v8a` by default; the manual Release workflow
> builds multi-ABI APKs.

### c. Local build

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/cwuom/NeriPlayer.git
   cd NeriPlayer
   ```
2. Open the project with the latest stable Android Studio and sync dependencies.
3. Build the Debug APK:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
   ```
4. Install the APK:
   ```bash
   adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```
5. On first launch, read the disclaimer and complete onboarding. The flow explains
   notification and local-music permissions, and requests them only after you choose
   to allow them; either can be skipped.
6. For debugging tools, tap the **version number** 7 times in Settings. A
   standalone `Debug` tab will appear in the bottom bar.

> Debug builds are for testing only. Their performance and size do not represent Release builds.

## Key Features

- 🎧 **Multi-source exploration and playback**:
  supports NetEase Cloud Music, Bilibili, YouTube Music, and local audio.
- 🏠 **Home recommendations and continue listening**:
  the Home page supports recently used playlists, all available NetEase recommendation
  sources, Radar playlists, and recommendation cards. It shows all available
  charts, new songs, daily picks, Private FM, high-quality playlists, and other
  feeds together; refreshing updates every section. International mode prioritizes
  YouTube Music home shelves.
- 🗂️ **Categorized Library browsing**:
  `Library` includes Local, Favorites, NetEase, YouTube Music, and Bilibili areas.
  YouTube can be fully disabled under Settings > General, which hides its entry
  points and stops related background warmups.
  Local content can switch between playlists/artists with search and artist
  sorting; Favorites can switch between playlists/artists; NetEase can switch
  between playlists/albums; Bilibili separates created favorites, subscribed
  favorites, and collections.
- 🔍 **Layered search**:
  `Explore` searches NetEase / Bilibili / YouTube Music separately.
  NetEase supports song, playlist, and artist categories, while NetEase and
  Bilibili results load the next page near the end of the list. The Link
  Recognition tab accepts either a direct URL or full share text containing a
  title and short link. It classifies NetEase songs/playlists/artists, Bilibili
  videos/favorites/collections/creators, and YouTube videos/playlists/channels;
  types with an existing detail screen open directly, while unsupported detail
  types are reported explicitly.
  Bilibili links preserve selected `p` / `cid` parts and `season_id` collection
  context where possible, so collection shares can open the matching collection list.
  The search field shows local search history and records debounced search
  keywords by default. You can disable Explore search history under Settings >
  General; disabling it hides the history and stops new records without deleting
  existing entries, which reappear when the setting is enabled again.
  Playback metadata completion uses NetEase / QQ Music and integrates LRCLIB
  as an external lyrics source. The lyrics editor lets users choose Kugou,
  NetEase, QQ Music, AMLL TTML, LRCLIB, and YouTube Music before manually
  matching lyrics, preferring word-level lyrics without hiding regular lyrics
  while automatically removing title and credit lines from matched lyrics.
- 🧠 **Media3 playback core**:
  `PlayerManager` handles playback resolution, queue state, shuffle/repeat,
  persistence, failure retry, playback URL refresh, YouTube prefetching, and
  platform-specific request policies.
  Shuffle generates a real shuffled queue first, then plays, persists, and displays
  that queue sequentially.
- YouTube playback preserves valid login cookies, supports cookie rotation and
  anonymous playback sessions, reuses bootstrap/`player.js`/PoToken caches with priority
  prefetching, and falls back to EJS/HLS after playback-candidate rejection.
- ⏩ **Optional BilibiliSponsorBlock auto-skip**: disabled by default. When enabled,
  the public API receives only a SHA-256 prefix of the current BV ID; matching
  page, duration, and `intro`/`outro`/`sponsor`/`music_offtopic`/`filler`/`padding` segments are
  skipped locally. No account data, playback history, or segment submissions are
  uploaded, and the feature remains disabled during Listen Together to prevent room
  state drift.
- ⏭️ **Custom Bilibili skip intervals**: manage multiple intervals for a video part
  from Now Playing's More Options or a Bilibili favorite/collection entry. Rules are
  persisted by `BVID + CID` and sync through GitHub/WebDAV. The Now Playing editor
  provides set-start/set-end, 5-second seek, and play/pause controls; local auto-skip
  remains off during Listen Together to avoid room-state drift.
- 🔁 **NetEase playback fallback**:
  when a NetEase song is unavailable, has no playable result, or only returns a
  preview clip, the player first tries lower quality. Bilibili and local-audio
  fallback are disabled by default and are attempted only after the user enables
  them; enabling can match a Bilibili candidate by title, artist, and duration or
  a readable local audio file by stable metadata.
- 🧯 **Playback failure fallback**:
  playback errors first try refreshing the active playback URL. Bilibili stream
  resolution retries missing DASH audio and can fall back to html5/mp4 progressive
  streams; repeated failures skip or stop playback to avoid getting stuck.
- 🎚️ **Playback sound controls**:
  Now Playing includes speed, pitch, loudness enhancer, Android system equalizer
  presets, and manual EQ bands. Playback settings also provide per-track
  real-time loudness normalization, channel balance, and 32-bit high-resolution
  system output. Loudness normalization is bypassed during USB exclusive playback;
  high-resolution system output keeps the high-precision pipeline where possible
  and bypasses loudness normalization, channel balance, audio visualization, and
  in-app speed processing.
- 🎛️ **Fine-grained playback behavior**:
  keep last playback progress, restore playback mode, fade-in/fade-out,
  crossfade-next, pause on Bluetooth disconnect, USB exclusive playback,
  mixed playback, and preemptive audio focus are configurable. Long-form progress
  memory is enabled by default only for tracks at least 15 minutes long; positions
  below 5 seconds are ignored, positions within 30 seconds of the end are cleared,
  and an explicitly requested position wins over remembered progress. The value is
  stored as `resumePositionMs` for local or optional sync and is not third-party
  playback history.
- 🔌 **USB exclusive playback**:
  supports **UAC1.0** and compatible **UAC2.0 Type I PCM** USB DAC devices, with
  device selection, sample-rate/bit-depth/buffer policies, compatibility toggles,
  and background-playback guidance. It also handles 32-bit PCM and software
  conversion from PCM float into the selected device format. When following the
  track sample rate, native exclusive output tries the exact source rate against
  USB descriptors first, then tries a reported compatible rate when the exact
  format is unavailable and compatibility fallback is enabled. Handling of Android's
  `USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED` event can be disabled separately when users do not want
  NeriPlayer to react to DAC insertion.
  Compatible UAC2 asynchronous topologies resolve a clock chain and explicit feedback endpoint,
  schedule packets from device feedback, and reacquire the feedback clock after
  long scheduling gaps. If playback startup, native transfer backpressure, or
  foreground/background transitions become unhealthy, the app tries in-place
  reconfiguration, coordinated AudioSink recreation, dynamic transfer scaling,
  and soft recovery before falling back to Android system output. Foreground/background
  recovery chooses wake behavior for network or local playback, and bit-perfect volume
  keeps software gain at 0 dB for DAC-side volume control. Settings report battery-
  optimization and background-permission limits. A retained service playback uses a
  route-aware background audio anchor that selects silence or a zero-mean carrier,
  while MediaSession provides remote volume routing and the carrier remains inaudible
  user content.
- 💾 **Configurable streaming cache**:
  audio cache uses `SimpleCache + LRU`, defaults to **1 GB**, and supports
  cleanup for audio cache, image cache, download staging, share staging, and
  platform playlist cache, with grouped storage usage details.
- 🛰️ **Offline mode**:
  automatically detects network availability, disables online Explore and remote
  Home refreshes while offline, and uses cached images only for remote artwork.
  Local files, downloaded audio, playback cache, playlists, recent plays, and
  playback stats remain available.
- ⬇️ **In-app downloads and management**:
  supports multi-platform audio downloads, task progress, cancel/retry, and
  local management with lyrics, covers, metadata, and audio tags. Default
  download concurrency is **6**, configurable up to **8**. Download queues are
  persisted so unfinished work can recover after restart, while complete local
  files can settle directly as finished. Platform transfers that require explicit
  Range requests resume by offset; if post-download tag writing fails, the
  finalized audio file is retained.
- 📁 **Migratable download directory**:
  downloads default to the app-managed directory, but can be moved to a custom
  SAF directory. Existing downloads are migrated when switching directories.
  Custom filename templates are also supported. For performance, avoid moving
  to SAF unless an external directory is actually needed.
- 🎵 **Local audio import and scanning**:
  supports system `VIEW / SEND / SEND_MULTIPLE` for `audio/*`, device music
  scanning, authorized-folder scanning, and nearby sidecar lyrics/covers.
  Large scans can show a quick preview first, filter to tracks with existing metadata,
  and then continue background metadata hydration; an empty SAF listing cannot
  accidentally clear an existing directory index.
- 👤 **Local artist grouping and detail pages**:
  local songs are grouped by display artist automatically, including common
  `feat.`, `with`, Chinese conjunction, punctuation, and slash-separated artist
  forms. Local artist pages support play-all, multi-select, playlist export,
  and batch downloads for online-source songs.
- 🩷 **Local playlists and favorites**:
  built-in "My Favorite Music" and "Local Files" system playlists. "Local Files"
  separates manually added and downloaded songs as independent sources, so a downloaded
  song that was also manually added appears in both tabs. Removing a manually added song
  only removes its playlist entry, while confirming deletion of a downloaded song also
  removes its managed download files. User playlists support create, rename,
  delete, reorder, and add-song actions. Playlist or song deletion shows undo
  feedback, and batch export into a local playlist confirms the target and can
  undo newly added items. Each detail shows the total play count, and Favorites
  offers playlist, artist, and Hot categories with playable weekly/monthly playlists
  generated from personal song listening. "My Favorite Music" can sync
  recognizable songs to NetEase Liked Songs.
- 🧑‍🎤 **NetEase artist pages**:
  NetEase songs can open artist pages with artist metadata, paged songs/albums,
  and follow/unfollow support. Followed artists appear in the Library Favorites
  artist category.
- 🧺 **NetEase playlist detail cache**:
  playlist detail pages cache headers and track lists. Reopening a playlist can
  show local data first, and network or parse failures can fall back to the last
  successful load.
- ☁️ **GitHub / WebDAV sync**:
  optional sync for local playlists, favorite playlists, recent plays, track and
  playlist playback stats, and deletion records through `WorkManager`, stored in the user's own
  remote.
- 📊 **Playback stats**:
  records play count, accumulated listen time, first/last played time, and daily
  stat buckets by stable track identity. Day/week/month/year/all-time views use trailing 1/7/30/365-day windows and are
  available, and stats can be synced through GitHub/WebDAV when configured.
  Playlist opens and local-playlist total/daily plays also use device shards during
  sync merges; weekly/monthly Hot playlists are generated from synced song listening stats.
  Weekly Hot requires at least 10 minutes of accumulated listening per track, and
  Monthly Hot requires 30 minutes.
  Sync merging preserves aggregate totals and daily buckets, and can lift older
  bucket-only data into visible totals. Writes are
  debounced and flushed at important lifecycle points, with a retention bound on daily buckets.
- 📶 **Traffic stats and download risk prompts**:
  tracks playback/download bytes, Wi-Fi/mobile/roaming distribution, and cache
  hits, and can warn before downloads on mobile data or roaming.
- ♻️ **Backup and restore**:
  playlist JSON import/export, plus full config import/export for settings,
  language, platform auth, GitHub/WebDAV config, and Listen Together settings.
- 🎧 **Listen Together**:
  create or join rooms, sync playback state over WebSocket, support host/listener
  permissions, member-control toggles, automatic pause for new members and explicit
  departures when enabled (same-member reconnects do not pause), repeat/shuffle mode sync,
  optional sharing of controller-resolved stream URLs,
  invite links, deep links, custom server URLs, and host-offline detection. A first join
  requires the invite secret and member reconnects use member secrets. Controllers can copy the
  complete invite or its secret separately; tapping Join reads a valid invite from the clipboard
  and does not enter a room when none is present. Local tracks cannot create a room or replace
  its current track. When sharing is enabled, the Worker caches and exposes only the current
  controller URL; disabling sharing clears that cache. The Worker keeps at most three
  deduplicated HTTP(S) candidates for the current track; listeners resolve their own quality
  policy first, try local candidates first, and retain shared candidates as session-scoped startup
  fallbacks. Candidates are never written to normal song or offline caches. Shuffle requests reuse
  the requester's validated real queue order, disabling shuffle restores that order without
  reloading the current song. Queue reorder/add/remove actions carry versioned replayable intents
  so concurrent room edits converge without replacing the current track by a stale index, and
  playback-mode commits re-anchor room position. Single-track
  repeat wraps position by track duration. Outdated client control events are filtered, and
  `REQUEST_SET_TRACK` can only choose a song already in the current queue.
- 🌈 **Personalization and themes**:
  auto/light/dark mode, dynamic color, seed colors, theme styles, UI scaling,
  custom background image, haptic feedback, lyric font size (separate cover and
  lyrics-page controls), lyric blur, default start destination, and Home card
  toggles. Android 13+ can optionally
  enable Enhanced Advanced Blur for top/bottom tabs and structural settings cards;
  its radius is adjustable from `12-64 dp`, and disabling the parent preserves the
  child choice and radius while removing enhanced drawing. Blur quality is separately
  selectable as Ultra Low, Low, Default, or High. Low and Ultra Low retain Default's
  coverage while using local rendering, dynamic downsampling, and hardware caching to
  reduce work; a Dimensity device defaults to Ultra Low when no preference is saved and
  rebuilds its local cache after foreground recovery or a quality change.
- ✨ **Now Playing visuals and lyrics**:
  `RuntimeShader` / GLSL fluid background, audio-reactive dynamic background,
  cover blur background, Apple Music-style lyrics, advanced lyrics, word-timed
  lyrics, translated lyrics, lyric offset, phonetic display, long-press lyric
  sharing, lyric card generation, lyric editing, font scaling, independent cover
  and lyrics-page lyric / translation font scales, lyric-aware haptics, and a
  full Lyrics page. RuntimeShader animation is enabled on Android
  13+; cover blur requires Android 12+, while advanced blur requires Android 13+.
- 👆 **Mini Player gestures**:
  the bottom Mini Player supports horizontal swipe for previous/next while
  keeping tap-to-expand and play/pause controls.
- 🧩 **Home screen widgets**:
  includes a 4x2 playback card and a 2x2 mini player. Card backgrounds and the primary
  play button derive their colors from the current artwork; the 4x2 card adds progress,
  four direct controls, and floating-lyrics access, while 2x2 keeps artwork as the main
  visual and retains the three core playback controls. Progress is updated locally once
  per second during playback and immediately on pause or track changes.
- 🚀 **Launcher shortcuts**:
  long-pressing the app icon can continue the previous queue, open Explore, open
  Library, or shuffle My Favorite Music. Empty queues or empty favorites report
  feedback instead of failing silently.
- 🪟 **Floating and status-bar lyrics**:
  system overlay lyrics with customizable color, outline, font size, position,
  alignment, and translation display, plus Meizu status-bar lyrics for select
  devices, SuperLyric output, and auto-hide while the app is foregrounded.
- 🔌 **External lyrics/device integration**:
  Lyricon integration, SuperLyric, external Bluetooth lyrics, pause on Bluetooth
  disconnect, and USB exclusive playback toggles. The external lyrics path
  receives the current song, playback state, position, word-level lyrics,
  and translations. Original and translated Bluetooth lyrics have independent
  switches; when both are enabled, they use separate title and artist fields while
  track identity remains available through album/description metadata.
- 🛠️ **Developer mode and debug tools**:
  tap the version number **7 times** to reveal the `Debug` tab, including
  YouTube / Bili / NetEase / Search / Listen Together probes, log viewer, and
  crash log viewer.
- 🧾 **Friendlier sign-in and logging**:
  NetEase and Bilibili support QR login with web-login fallback. Persistent file
  logging can also be enabled outside developer mode for hard-to-reproduce bugs.
- 🛟 **Safe mode and crash logs**:
  if the previous startup hit a JVM/native crash or system ANR, the app can boot
  directly into safe mode so you can inspect or export the log and selectively
  clear settings or auth data.

---

## Platform Status

- **NetEase Cloud Music**:
  login, song search, curated playlists, albums, playlist/album list search,
  playback, downloads, lyrics, playback metadata completion, playback fallback
  for restricted playback, syncing local favorites to NetEase Liked Songs,
  artist pages, paged artist songs/albums, and artist follow support.
- **Bilibili**:
  web login, QR login, video search, created favorites, subscribed favorites,
  collections, favorite/collection list search, multi-part video-to-audio
  playback, and downloads.
  Link recognition keeps the selected part and can recover collection context
  from `season_id` or video details.
  It is not a full video discovery or comments client.
- **YouTube Music**:
  login, home/library playlist browsing, playlist details, search, playback compatibility,
  PoToken, and JS Challenge support. Content access remains bound by platform rules
  and the user's account permissions.
- **QQ Music**:
  currently used only for playback metadata and lyrics completion. Login,
  playback, and library data are not implemented.
- **Local audio**:
  external share/open import, device scanning, authorized-folder scanning,
  local file playback, local artist grouping, sharing, and local playlist management.

## Implementation Notes

### Build and versions

- `compileSdk = 37`
- `targetSdk = 36`
- `minSdk = 28`
- Java 17 / Kotlin JVM 17
- NDK `27.0.12077973`
- CMake `3.28.0+`
- Version name format: `<git_short_hash>.<MMddHHmm>`
- Release APK filename: `NeriPlayer-<versionName>[-abi].apk`
- Release builds are `arm64-v8a` by default. Use `-PbuildAllReleaseAbis=true`
  for multi-ABI output.
- `.github/workflows/android_native_ci.yml` runs Release + `-Werror`,
  ASan+UBSan, and TSan host CTest profiles for native changes, then separately
  compiles `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, and `x86_64` Android ABIs.

### Module layout

- `:app`: main Android application.
- `:ksp-annotations` / `:ksp-processor`: generated settings registration and metadata.
- `:accompanist-lyrics-core` / `:accompanist-lyrics-ui`: lyrics parsing and Compose lyrics UI submodules.
- `build-logic`: shared Gradle convention plugins.
- `buildSrc`: retained auxiliary Gradle build logic.
- `np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW`: Listen Together Cloudflare Workers server.
- `np-submodule/miuix`: vendored upstream Miuix source/docs tree, not part of the current app module graph.

### Entry point and navigation

- `MainActivity` is the only external entry point. It handles startup, notification
  permission, external audio imports, USB attach events, and
  `neriplayer://listen-together/join` links.
- If the previous launch ended with a JVM/native crash or system ANR, the app
  enters `Safe Mode` first and exposes only recovery and export actions.
- The main UI is **Compose NavHost + dynamic bottom bar**:
  `Home / Explore / Library / Settings` are the primary tabs.
- `Home` is displayed dynamically based on available Home cards. `Debug` appears
  only after enabling developer mode.
- `MainTabLayerHost` retains outgoing and incoming main-tab scenes and moves them
  horizontally according to tab order. Each scene owns saved state and its own
  advanced-glass owner, and interrupted reverse switches continue from the
  current transition progress.
- Detail pages use a drawer-style rise over a slightly recessed background by
  default. Enabling Coherent feedback switches to a coupled background/detail
  handoff.
- `Now Playing` is a full-screen layer above main navigation, with a persistent
  bottom `Mini Player`. The Mini Player supports horizontal swipe for previous/next.
- `LauncherShortcuts` maps app-icon shortcuts to continue playback, Explore,
  Library, and shuffle-favorites requests without bypassing normal navigation
  or playback-service state recovery.
- `Library` uses paged navigation for Local, Favorites, NetEase, YouTube Music,
  Bilibili, and the QQ Music placeholder. It also exposes Recent Plays and
  Playback Stats.
- Local Library has playlist/artist categories; Favorites has playlist/artist
  categories; NetEase has playlist/album categories.
- `LocalArtistDetailScreen` handles local artist pages with play-all,
  multi-select, playlist export, and batch downloads for online songs.
  `NeteaseArtistDetailScreen` handles NetEase artist songs/albums and follow state.
- Tablet and landscape layouts constrain content width and adjust bottom control
  areas on Now Playing, Lyrics, artist detail, and Settings pages to avoid overly
  wide content and scattered controls.

### Playback, cache, and service

- Playback is based on Media3 ExoPlayer and managed by `PlayerManager`.
- `AudioPlayerService` provides foreground playback, media notifications,
  MediaSession, and basic transport controls.
- Bilibili playback uses `ConditionalHttpDataSourceFactory` to append
  `Referer / User-Agent / Cookie`.
- YouTube Music playback includes platform range-transfer compatibility, seek refresh policy,
  and prefetching. Login cookies, anonymous sessions, bootstrap, `player.js`, and
  PoToken caches are reused, with EJS/HLS fallback after playback-candidate rejection.
  Large seeks in long YouTube audio use a shorter startup-recovery window instead
  of waiting for the normal playback-start watchdog timeout.
- NetEase playback automatically tries lower quality when the current quality is
  unavailable, and can switch to a matched Bilibili or local-audio fallback candidate
  for restricted or preview-only tracks.
- Playback state is persisted periodically for queue and state recovery.
- Player code is split by responsibility across `playback/`, `url/`, `resolver/`,
  `service/`, `effects/`, `lifecycle/`, `watchdog/`, and `usb/`. Shared song
  models live under `data/model/`; legacy packages only retain a small set of
  compatibility aliases and should not be used for new code.
- Sleep timer, fade-in/fade-out, crossfade-next, and playback mode recovery are
  handled in the player layer.
- Preemptive audio focus, mixed playback, pause on Bluetooth disconnect, and
  USB exclusive playback are stored in playback preference snapshots so they are
  available early in player startup.
- USB exclusive playback currently supports **UAC1.0** and compatible
  **UAC2.0 Type I PCM** devices, with device selection, sample-rate/bit-depth/
  buffer policies, compatibility toggles, and background buffer tuning.
  It can use 32-bit PCM and software PCM-float conversion. Native exclusive
  output tries the exact source rate first and only tries a reported compatible
  rate when the exact format is unavailable and compatibility fallback is enabled.
  Compatible UAC2 asynchronous explicit-feedback topologies resolve the clock
  chain, feedback endpoint, and report period. Runtime Report v2 exposes feedback
  state, endpoint, rate, holdover, and long-gap reacquisition counters. To reduce
  stuck states, the player layer also includes startup watchdogs,
  foreground/background health audits, keep-alive checks, generation-coordinated
  AudioSink reconfiguration, dynamic transfer scaling, native-transfer
  backpressure recovery, and system-output fallback. A deferred native runtime
  refresh is retried only within a bounded budget. Wake behavior follows the
  network or local source, foreground recovery can restore USB-exclusive playback,
  and bit-perfect volume keeps software gain at 0 dB. USB attach handling is
  controlled by a setting; when disabled, both the Activity alias and playback
  service ignore the `USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED` wake path.

### Search and data sources

- **UI search**:
  `Explore` integrates NetEase, Bilibili, and YouTube Music as separate sources.
  NetEase can switch among songs, playlists, and artists; NetEase and Bilibili
  support lazy pagination; Link Recognition accepts direct links and share text
  containing short links. Bilibili video links preserve `p` / `cid` part targets,
  while collection shares prefer the UGC season from video details and fall back
  to the linked `season_id` when needed. Search history is local and can be independently
  hidden and disabled under Settings > General.
- **Metadata completion**:
  the playback screen uses `SearchManager` with NetEase and QQ Music for cover,
  lyrics, and track metadata.
- **Lyrics**:
  besides platform lyrics, LRCLIB is available as an external lyrics client.
  The lyrics editor has a dedicated Match entry where the search keyword can be
  edited, sources are selected before searching, and results are cached
  temporarily by source. Changing the source filter updates cached candidates
  locally without repeated requests. Matched lyrics automatically drop title,
  credit, and production-info lines before candidates are ranked by title,
  artist, album, duration, and lyric type, preferring word-level lyrics while
  keeping regular lyric candidates. The player supports original lyrics,
  translated lyrics, phonetic lyrics, word timing, lyric sharing, and manual
  editing.
- **Lyricon integration**:
  `LyriconManager` outputs the current song, playback state, position,
  word-level lyrics, and translated lyrics to Lyricon and SuperLyric. Position is
  sent through an independent 200 ms feed loop anchored to elapsed realtime. Translation
  lines are matched by timing, lyric-card caching is retained, and song sharing can produce
  Xiaomi Super Island URLs.
  Status-bar lyrics depend on vendor support and currently target select devices.
- **Artist entry points**:
  NetEase search, Home, playlist/album detail pages, and Now Playing try to keep
  `neteaseArtists` metadata so the UI can open NetEase artist detail pages.
- **NetEase playlist cache**:
  `NeteasePlaylistCacheRepository` caches playlist headers, tracks, recent-track
  signatures, and save time. `NeteaseCollectionDetailViewModel` can publish cached
  data before refreshing the network and reuse the cache when the signature is
  unchanged or a network/parse failure occurs.

### Local data and security

- General settings use `DataStore`. KSP generates setting keys, backup allowlists,
  and settings UI metadata.
- Theme mode is represented by `ThemeMode`, with light, dark, and Auto
  follow-system behavior.
- Platform cookies, YouTube auth data, GitHub tokens, and WebDAV passwords are
  stored locally with `Android Keystore + EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
- Play history, playback stats, playlists, favorite snapshots, and mappings are
  persisted through local files.
- Local playlists are stored as JSON with atomic temp-file writes.
- Sync payload models shared by GitHub and WebDAV live under `data/sync/model/`,
  while cover mapping lives under `data/sync/`. GitHub/WebDAV managers and
  transports remain in their provider packages; compatibility serialization and
  most merge policies currently remain under `sync/github/`.
  Deletion records and undo operations participate in the same merge policy so
  locally restored songs are not removed again by stale deletion records on the
  next sync.
- GitHub/WebDAV sync uses a locally generated UUID as the device identifier,
  not `ANDROID_ID`.
- GitHub sync creates a raw binary blob through the Git Data API, writes it through
  a tree and commit, and advances the default branch with a non-force ref update.
  Reads use the raw content endpoint; Base64 in blob requests is only the API
  transport envelope and does not change the stored body. Sync payloads are capped
  at 12 MiB, with raw `GZIP(ProtoBuf)` in Data Saver mode and UTF-8 JSON otherwise.

### Downloads, local import, and backups

- Downloads use a shared `OkHttpClient`, not the system `DownloadManager`.
- Default download concurrency is **6**, configurable up to **8** in Settings.
- Downloads are first written into `cache/download_staging` working files, then
  committed into the app-managed directory or a user-selected SAF directory.
  Audio metadata is prepared before commit, and lyrics, covers, `.npmeta.json`,
  and audio tags are written after the audio file is finalized.
- `DownloadTaskStore` persists queued work and task state. On startup,
  `GlobalDownloadManager` waits for active/queued work to settle before restoring
  unfinished tasks, so stale queues and new requests do not overwrite each other.
- If completed audio can be found quickly through the download index or cached
  snapshot, the task is settled as complete without re-fetching the stream or
  repeatedly probing SAF storage.
- Downloads support **automatic resume**, but the strategy depends on transport type:
  - **Direct HTTP transfers** resume through `Range: bytes=<offset>-`
  - **Chunked range transfers** resume by byte offset, mainly for platform candidates
    that require explicit range requests
  - **HLS downloads** resume from a saved segment index plus downloaded byte count
    through a `.hls.json` checkpoint
- Each working file also stores `.resume.json` metadata so unfinished downloads
  can be reconstructed after app restart. `GlobalDownloadManager` scans and
  restores resumable downloads on startup.
- Transient network failures try to keep partial data. Downloads that enter
  `WAITING_NETWORK` because Wi-Fi was lost also keep their working files and can
  continue after network recovery or user confirmation.
- Manual cancellation is different from pause/resume: it cleans up working files
  and rolls back partially committed audio/sidecar artifacts.
- Download indexes keep snapshot caches and sidecar references to reduce SAF
  directory walks. An empty SAF listing cannot clear an existing directory index.
  Android SAF access is still much slower than the app-private directory, so custom
  directories are recommended only when they are really needed.
- `StorageUsageAnalyzer` groups storage into cleanable cache, downloaded content,
  diagnostics, and app data. Cache cleanup removes regenerable cache/staging files,
  not user-saved downloaded songs.
- `LocalAudioImportManager` imports external audio, scans device music, and copies
  nearby `lrc/txt` lyrics and `cover/folder/front` images.
- Local-song sharing exposes a controlled directory URI directly when possible;
  SAF/content URIs that cannot be exposed are staged under
  `cache/shared_local_media`, which is cleanable cache.
- Local scan previews can filter to tracks that already have metadata. After a
  local playlist is created or enriched, the app can continue hydrating titles,
  artists, albums, and covers in the background while preserving edited local metadata.
- Download "metadata post-processing" can be disabled separately. When disabled,
  NeriPlayer still keeps management metadata, but stops writing tags, lyrics,
  and covers back into the audio file itself.
- `BackupManager` supports playlist JSON export/import and diff analysis.
- `ConfigFileManager` supports full config export/import for migration.

## Listen Together Deployment

NeriPlayer includes a built-in "Listen Together" feature. You can deploy your
own server or use a server deployed by others.

Server source and deployment entry points:

- `np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW` inside this repository
- Public deployment template:
  [TheSmallHanCat/NeriPlayer-LTW](https://github.com/TheSmallHanCat/NeriPlayer-LTW)

The server is based on **Cloudflare Workers** and **Durable Objects**, using
WebSocket for real-time sync.

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/TheSmallHanCat/NeriPlayer-LTW)

The app can configure a Listen Together server URL, test availability, and reset
the local Listen Together identity from Settings.

Additional notes:

- Room IDs use a 6-character readable charset, and nicknames must be 1-24
  characters long using Chinese characters, letters, or digits
- A first join requires the invite secret, and local tracks cannot create a
  Listen Together room
- For full protocol, event, and deployment details, see
  [np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW/README.md](./np-submodule/NeriPlayer-LTW/README.md)

---

## GitHub Sync

NeriPlayer can sync local metadata to **your own GitHub repository**.
When created from inside the app, the repository defaults to private, and
existing repositories are also supported.

Current sync targets:

- Local playlists
- Favorite playlists
- Recent plays
- Recent play deletion records
- Playback stats

### Technical details

- 🔒 **Local secure storage**: GitHub tokens are stored with
  `Android Keystore + EncryptedSharedPreferences`.
- 🔄 **Scheduling**: local mutations trigger a sync **after 5 seconds**; an
  **hourly** periodic sync is also scheduled.
- ⏱️ **Eventual consistency**: this is background two-way sync, not real-time push.
- 🌐 **Network requirement**: sync runs through `WorkManager` and requires a
  **validated network**.
- 🧩 **Conflict handling**: three-way merge handles playlists, favorites, history,
  deletion records, and playback stats. Newly added or restored songs carry
  membership tokens, so an older deletion only removes membership it actually
  observed instead of deleting restored content during the next sync.
- 🧹 **Remote tolerance**: JSON/ProtoBuf sync snapshots tolerate legacy missing
  fields, filter malformed records without resolvable track identity or valid
  deletion time, and keep songs with missing `addedAt` behind dated songs so bad
  snapshots cannot jump ahead in playlists.
- 🪶 **Data Saver**: `backup-raw.bin` writes raw `GZIP(ProtoBuf)` bytes. The reader still
  accepts `backup.json` and legacy `backup.bin` Base64 formats; JSON is used when Data Saver
  is disabled. JSON, compressed, and decompressed payloads are capped at 8 MiB, 12 MiB, and
  16 MiB respectively.
- GitHub sync writes the raw payload through Git Data API blob/tree/commit calls and advances
  the default branch with a non-force ref update. Reads use raw content; Base64 in blob requests
  is only the API transport envelope. WebDAV servers without ETag/Last-Modified allow an
  unconditional write only when the remote SHA-256 fingerprint is unchanged; otherwise the
  sync reports a concurrency conflict.
- Upgrade Android and Desktop sync clients together before enabling Data Saver writes. New
  clients read raw GZIP, JSON, and legacy Base64, while older clients may only understand
  historical Base64 text.
- 📦 **Remote format**: a GitHub repository is not end-to-end encryption.
  You are responsible for protecting remote files.
- 🚫 **Sync boundary**: audio caches, downloaded files, local media files, cookies,
  and playback tokens are not uploaded.

### How to use

1. Open Backup & Sync in Settings.
2. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` permission.
3. Validate the token, then either create the default private repository or use an existing one.
4. Enable automatic sync, or run a manual sync.

---

## WebDAV Sync

NeriPlayer also supports storing the same sync data in a WebDAV remote file.

- Sync targets are the same as GitHub Sync.
- Automatic sync and manual sync are supported.
- `WorkManager` handles delayed sync, periodic sync, network checks, and retries.
- WebDAV URL, username, and password are stored in local encrypted storage.
- WebDAV prefers ETag/Last-Modified conditional writes. If a server exposes neither,
  an unconditional write is allowed only after the remote SHA-256 fingerprint still
  matches the snapshot that was read; otherwise the sync fails as a conflict.
- The remote WebDAV file is not an end-to-end encrypted backup.

## Known Issues

### Network

- Configure proxy rules carefully. Global proxying may cause abnormal responses
  from some third-party APIs.

### Limitations

- Downloads do not rely on the system download service. They support automatic
  resume and startup recovery, but they are not a system-level background
  downloader and do not sync downloaded media across devices.
- Manual download cancellation removes resume checkpoints and partial artifacts.
  Only network-policy pauses or recoverable errors keep resume state.
- Custom SAF download directories make files easier to access externally, but
  scanning, migration, and finalization are usually slower than the app-private directory.
- USB exclusive playback depends on a compatible **UAC1.0** or
  **UAC2.0 Type I PCM** USB DAC, the foreground service, and the system's
  background/battery policy. If playback is limited after the screen turns off,
  follow the in-app guidance to allow unrestricted background behavior.
- UAC2 asynchronous paths currently require a uniquely resolved explicit-feedback
  endpoint and a supported clock topology. Implicit feedback or unverified
  topologies are rejected as native candidates and use the compatibility fallback.
- The explicit-feedback path is covered by host-model tests and four-ABI Android
  compilation, but those results do not prove stability for a specific phone/DAC pair.
- 32-bit high-resolution system output only targets high-precision sources on
  regular Android system output and bypasses parts of the in-app audio processing
  chain. Keep it disabled when loudness normalization, channel balance, audio
  visualization, or in-app speed processing is required.
- Phonetic lyric display depends on phonetic data from the platform or embedded
  lyrics. The toggle stays unavailable when the current lyric has no phonetics.
- Lyric cards are written to the app cache for system sharing and can be removed
  later through cache cleanup.
- Bilibili mainly provides video search, favorites, collections, and audio playback.
  It is not a full video discovery client.
- QQ Music is only a playback metadata/lyrics completion source.
- GitHub/WebDAV sync is not end-to-end encrypted. Full config export files may
  contain auth data and must be protected by the user.
- Data Saver writes raw GZIP bytes to `backup-raw.bin`. New Android and Desktop builds
  retain `backup.json` and legacy `backup.bin` Base64 reads during migration, while
  GitHub uploads use Git Data API binary blobs and non-force branch updates.
- Long-form progress memory does not override an explicitly requested position or replace
  third-party playback history. BilibiliSponsorBlock calls a public API and stays disabled
  during Listen Together.

---

## Privacy

- NeriPlayer does not provide its own public cloud media distribution service,
  and does not include ad SDKs, third-party analytics, or third-party crash SDKs.
- The project follows a decentralized data strategy: you choose and control the
  sync target, and personal media data is not gathered into a maintainer-operated
  central platform.
- Playback cache, downloads, local playlists, history, playback stats, settings,
  and auth data are stored locally by default.
- If you enable GitHub or WebDAV sync, only metadata such as playlists, favorites,
  history, and playback stats are synced.
- Audio caches, downloaded files, cookies, and playback tokens are not uploaded
  to the developers.
- For account safety, the app does not write local playback history or playback
  stats back to third-party music platforms, because that kind of reporting may
  be misclassified by platform risk-control systems.
- Full config export files contain settings, auth data, and sync configuration.
  They are intended for personal migration and should not be shared publicly.
- Android system cloud backup / device transfer is disabled by default.
- Third-party platform logs and risk-control behavior are governed by the
  corresponding platforms' privacy policies.
